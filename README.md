# Bloonstar - Battles 2 Stats Website

Bloonstar is a Battles 2 statistics website providing players with hero and tower data accessible [here](https://www.bloonstar.com/).

If you have any questions or have feedback, message vTri on Discord.

The website as of current takes much tinkering for local development. We'll get that fixed as soon as possible
How to run a very bad version of this code:

1. Download the svelte packages through the command below
   `npm install`
2. Locally test using
   `npm run dev`
